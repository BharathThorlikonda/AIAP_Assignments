The loop variable `i` started at 0 and the code inside the loop printed `i` but never changed the value of `i`. Without an increment or decrement step that would eventually make the condition `i < 5` false, the loop would continue to run indefinitely.\n",

        "\n",
        "- `i += 1` is shorthand for `i = i + 1`.\n",
        "- This line increments the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n",
        "- As a result, `i` will take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",
        "- When `i` becomes 5, the condition `i < 5` is no longer true, and the loop terminates.\n",

        "This ensures that the loop runs a finite number of times (in this case, 5 times) and prevents the program from getting stuck in an infinite loop."
