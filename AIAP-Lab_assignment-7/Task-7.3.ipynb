        "- The code inside the `try` block is executed first. This is where the division `a / b` is attempted.\n",
        "- If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs (which happens when you try to divide by zero), the code inside the `except ZeroDivisionError:` block is executed.\n",
        "- In the `except` block, a message \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\" is printed, and the function returns `float('inf')` to indicate an infinite result, which is a common way to represent the result of division by zero in floating-point arithmetic.\n",
        "- If no `ZeroDivisionError` occurs (like when dividing 10 by 2), the `except` block is skipped, and the function simply returns the result of the division from the `try` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach prevents the program from crashing when encountering a division by zero and provides a more graceful way to handle this potential error."
