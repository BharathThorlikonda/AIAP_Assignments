        "The original faulty code attempted to access an index (5) that was outside the valid range of the `numbers` list, which only has indices 0, 1, and 2. This would result in an `IndexError`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The corrected code uses a `try...except` block to handle this potential error:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The code inside the `try` block is executed first. This is where the potentially problematic operation, accessing `numbers[5]`, is attempted.\n",
        "- If an `IndexError` occurs because the index is out of range, the code inside the `except IndexError:` block is executed.\n",
        "- In the `except` block, a user-friendly error message \"Error: Index out of range! Showing safe access instead.\" is printed.\n",
        "- It then demonstrates \"safe access\" by printing the last valid element of the list using `numbers[-1]`. This provides a useful alternative or fallback when the requested index is invalid.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach prevents the program from crashing due to an `IndexError` and provides a way to gracefully handle such situations, informing the user about the error and potentially offering a safe alternative action."
