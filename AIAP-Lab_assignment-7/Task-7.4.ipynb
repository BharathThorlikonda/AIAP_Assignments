        "**Explanation of the fix:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, instance methods (like `__init__` and `greet`) within a class automatically receive the instance of the class as the first argument. This instance is conventionally named `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Original faulty code:** `def __init__(name):`\n",
        "  Here, `self` was missing. When you create an instance of `MyClass`, Python tries to pass the instance to `__init__`, but the method was only expecting one argument (`name`). This caused an error because the instance was being passed but there was no parameter to receive it before `name`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Corrected code:** `def __init__(self, name):`\n",
        "  By adding `self` as the first parameter, the `__init__` method is now correctly defined to accept the instance of the class as its first argument, followed by any other arguments (in this case, `name`). Inside the method, `self.name = name` correctly assigns the value of the `name` argument to an attribute of the instance (`self.name`).\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, the `greet` method is correctly defined with `self` as the first parameter, allowing it to access the instance's attributes like `self.name`."
