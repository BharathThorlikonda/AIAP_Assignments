        "The original `read_file` function lacked proper error handling, which could lead to issues like `FileNotFoundError` or unclosed file handles. I've refactored it to use a `try-except` block to catch potential `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError` exceptions. Additionally, `with open()` is used to ensure the file is automatically closed, even if errors occur.\n",
